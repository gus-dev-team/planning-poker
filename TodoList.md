# Things to do

1. Finish the cards design.[done]
2. The hide/reveal button should change a new property called "hidden: default set to true" on the Room Schema. At the momment, the player can simply look at everyone else's cards without them knowing about it.[done]
3. Revamp the players list to be smaller cards with the corresponding player name below it, with a backface if the cards are hidden, with a frontface showing the picked card from that player when the voting is over. Extra-points if I can put those cards around the table instead of inside a auto-scroll box over the table.[done]
