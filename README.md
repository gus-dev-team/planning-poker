Here is how you can run this project on your localserver:

1. Start a MongoDB server to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017.
2. On a terminal with node installed, change directory to the server folder and run 'npm start' (don't forget to run 'npm install' beforehand).
3. On a second terminal, change the directory to the client folder and run 'npm start' (don't forget to run 'npm install' beforehand).
4. On your browser, simply access 'http://localhost:3000/' and voil√°.
